#clean-me

Browser extension that utilizes Yahoo's open source deep neural model open_nsfw, available here:

(https://github.com/yahoo/open_nsfw)

*clean-me* will identify all potential NSFW images/links to images on a website and 

a)allow you to not display these

b)mark them on your display according their NSFWness

Images/links are categorized as follows by default:


| Score         | Color         | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| 0 - .3        | Green         | 
| .3 - .6       | Yellow        |  
| .6 - 1        | Red           | 



You may change your categorization settings by navigating to the *clean-me* icon in the right corner of Chrome and then to the settings icon
